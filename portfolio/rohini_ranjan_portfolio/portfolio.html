            I’m a passionate learner with a focus on data analytics, data science, website development, quality assurance, and UI/UX design. I use tools like Python, R, SQL, and Tableau for data analysis, and TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for machine learning. In web development, I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, while also leveraging Figma for design. I ensure high-quality work with Jest and Cypress for testing. I’m always eager to learn new technologies to create user-friendly and impactful digital experiences.

              I gained practical experience working with key tools and
              technologies used in data engineering. I learned how to
              efficiently handle data using SQL and Python, processed large
              datasets using PySpark, and worked with databases like Postgres. I
              also explored data storage and management techniques with Big Data
              technologies, Data Lakes, and Hadoop. Additionally, I got hands-on
              experience with cloud platforms such as GCP to implement ETL
              processes and manage data workflows. This course equipped me with
              the skills to build robust data pipelines and perform data
              engineering tasks at scale.

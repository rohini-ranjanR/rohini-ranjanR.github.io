    <h2 class="insight_process">Data Analytics Process</h2>
    <h4 class="insight_overview">Data Overview</h3>
        <p class="insight_process_para">Take a look at the data, check for the field and columns we have in data, and
            analyse which one will going to help us in getting the result. <br>
            So, in this case we have Row ID, Order ID, Order Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment,
            Country, City, State, Region, Product ID, Category, Sub category, Product Name, Sales, Quantity, Profit,
            Returns, Payment mode.</p>
        <div class="cleaning">
            <h4 class="insight_cleaning">Importing and Data Cleaning in Power BI</h3>

                <p>
                    I have imported files by clicking on get date then csv option, after that the data will appear and we can either load or transform.
                    But in my case I clicked transform as I wanted to make some corrections and perform some operations on it. If we have already analyzed data and the data is 100% cleaned we can simply
                    load it. As I had the data that need to be cleaned first, then it can be loaded.
                    <br>
                    After transformation, checked for the missing data, check the data type. Remove null value from view
                    option. If we want to change the header name to just column 1, 2 then we can do that from transform
                    data then click on use first row as header. Easy way to remove duplicates is just to go to remove
                    rows under home tab then click remove duplicates. Checked every column for error values. 
                </p>


                <div class="Visualization">
                    <h4 class="insight_visualization">Dashboard Creation:</h4>
                    <p>Use Canvas background to give a brand colour, gave the colour to charts and customize it
                        according by using general settings and using visual we customize values and presentation of
                        charts. <br>
                        We can customize colour using the function value, I used normal colours here. Turned on tool top
                        to show value while hover. <br><br>
                        Similarly, we choose chart to present sub category, and list down it to 3 data. Then I have
                        created a chart that represents ship mode. <br><br>
                        Similarly, we used different charts to represent different values. By using different legends,
                        we create sales analytics of 2 years in one chart and then we can compare it. <br>
                        Then we have created a chart comparison based on profit. We use map to get the geographical
                        location of customers. Here we can use sales as bubble now the bigger bubble will show more
                        sales from that location and small bubble will show lesser sale. We can use tool tip option here
                        too so that if someone hover over it, it will show the value or numbers there.
                        <br><br>
                        We now wanted to use donut chart to represent customer segment and why we use it because donut
                        chart will show it in segmented format. We use chart when that chart meets the requirement.
                        <br><br>
                        Then we created a filter in form of tiles based on the tile option the charts will show the
                        results accordingly.
                        <br><br>
                        Then we use KPIs using card from the visualizations, we will use that visualization and will use
                        the values there. Like sales to show the KPIs, we use KPIs based on the requirements. Use those
                        values in KPI that will represent the total value.
                    </p>

                <div class="sales_dax_queries">
                    <h4 class="sales_dax">DAX Queries:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Go to data view and add a new column from there where we will going to perform DAX queries in
                        order to solve our problem statement. <br><br>
                        In this case I am taking “AvgDelivery” that will provide average delivery time to reach the
                        product to the customer. Now in case if a company wanted to know the average delivery rate to
                        analyze their service, they can see this directly from the visualization. <br><br>
                        AvgDelivery = DATEDIF(‘SuperStore_Sales’[Order Date’], ‘SuperStore’ [Ship Date], DAY)
                        This will give us the number of days the order takes to deliver. Now to show the average rate of
                        delivery days, we can use KPI to get the average delivery days.
                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="salesforecasting">
                    <h4 class="salesforecast">Forecasting: </h4>
                    <p>
                        Forecasting is the process where we get the future expectations or future results based on
                        current
                        Create a new sheet for forecasting, for forcasting we have to first create a line chart,
                        forcasting is based on time series, so we will use order date and sales, then we will get a
                        straight line having data based on year, we can customize is by removing year then we will get
                        month based chart, after removing month we will get more specific days based chart. In this case
                        we will get a 30 days data. We can change it into order date from dropdown and then it will show
                        all the data of 2 years per day. For forcasting, go to the the add further analysis third icon
                        and then select
                        forcast option from there. Customize the days, ignore the last that will ignore the data of last
                        date, confidence interval, after this we will get forcast upper and lower value, this will
                        provide forcast value of 15 days, and we can export it or show as table too.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="table_dax">
                    <h4 class="sales_table_dax"> Table Dax: </h4>
                    <p>
                    In forecasting process, we will have duplicate order dates and in such case Power BI is using
                    aggregate method itself. Now if we want to have single and unique result using single values only,
                    this will be done using DAX query. We will go to data view, then table tools, click on new table,
                    then name the table SalesForecast, we will use orderdate and sales column, use formula summarize,
                    and write the table name, then column name and one more attribute of sales there from the same table
                    name.
                    Now we get the table from there. Now we will get unique dates only and it will aggregate all the
                    sales accordingly.
